For the motion I chose continuous movement. The reason I decided on it was due to the limited area that an escape room can give. With it, it's easier to give immersion which adds on to the experience. Compared to teleportation, it gives less sense of coexistence to the XR world. After some time in getting it done, I think that it was well put together.
The interactions that was implemented, I believe that they will help out in giving some essence of usability in the final focus project. I chose a lever, in which I will use to make it restart rather than spawn items via hinge joint, but knowing that it works leaves me room to hopefully tie down the restart function. Even so, I also made a remote to turn a TV on, which will help me understand better on how to apply proper images to make instructions for controllers and controls for the TV. With the both of them, I think they will help in making my game, one for giving instructions and a timer, the other giving a full restart.
